# Hypothesis-Testing-With-ANOVA
The Project is aim to test about How the impact of education level to income. I am testing the hypothesis with ANOVA Test. The data of this project is from Kaggle source, namely marketing campaign. 
The data spread, mostly the customers are from Graduation Education bacground.
ANOVA Test shows that there is a significant impact of the education level to income. We can conclude that the higher income, have willingness to pay and willingness to buy is higher than below category.

Based on the analysis, this result could be used to create a marketing strategy and planning. Where, nowadays the company can apply the marketing strategy with focusing on the higher income/education first of all.
